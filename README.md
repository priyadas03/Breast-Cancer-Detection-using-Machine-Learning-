# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-
## About Data
This report is based on a dataset consisting of information about breast cancer diagnoses. The dataset contains 33 columns and 569 rows, with each row representing a patient and each column representing a different feature of the patient's diagnosis. The first column contains a unique identifier for each patient, while the second column contains information about whether the patient's diagnosis was malignant (M) or benign (B).
The following columns contain numerical data about various physical characteristics of the tumor, such as radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, concave points_mean, and so on. These features are calculated from images of the tumor that were taken using digital mammography.
## Project Report:

The objective of this project is to analyze the dataset and build a machine learning model to predict whether a breast cancer diagnosis is malignant or benign based on the physical characteristics of the tumor.

## Data Description:

The dataset contains the following columns:

id: A unique identifier for each patient


diagnosis: Whether the diagnosis is malignant (M) or benign (B)


radius_mean: Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter


texture_mean: Standard deviation of gray-scale values


perimeter_mean: Perimeter of the tumor


area_mean: Area of the tumor


smoothness_mean: Local variation in radius lengths


compactness_mean: Perimeter^2 / area - 1.0


concavity_mean: Severity of concave portions of the contour


concave points_mean: Number of concave portions of the contour


symmetry_mean: Symmetry of tumor


fractal_dimension_mean: "Coastline approximation" - 1


radius_se: Standard error of mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
