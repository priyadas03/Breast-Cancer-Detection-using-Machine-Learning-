# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-
## About Data
This report is based on a dataset consisting of information about breast cancer diagnoses. The dataset contains 33 columns and 569 rows, with each row representing a patient and each column representing a different feature of the patient's diagnosis. The first column contains a unique identifier for each patient, while the second column contains information about whether the patient's diagnosis was malignant (M) or benign (B).
The following columns contain numerical data about various physical characteristics of the tumor, such as radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, concave points_mean, and so on. These features are calculated from images of the tumor that were taken using digital mammography.
## Project Report:

The objective of this project is to analyze the dataset and build a machine learning model to predict whether a breast cancer diagnosis is malignant or benign based on the physical characteristics of the tumor.
